      <p>
        ONCE there was a gentleman who married, for his second wife, the
        proudest and most haughty woman that was ever seen. She had, by a former
        husband, two daughters of her own humor, who were, indeed, exactly like
        her in all things. He had likewise, by another wife, a young daughter,
        but of unparalleled goodness and sweetness of temper, which she took
        from her mother, who was the best creature in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        She could not bear the good qualities of this pretty girl, and the less
        because they made her own daughters appear the more odious. She employed
        her in the meanest work of the house: she scoured the dishes, tables,
        etc., and scrubbed madam's chamber, and those of misses, her daughters;
        she lay up in a sorry garret, upon a wretched straw bed, while her
        sisters lay in fine rooms, with floors all inlaid, upon beds of the very
        newest fashion, and where they had looking-glasses so large that they
        might see themselves at their full length from head to foot.
      </p>
      <p>
        No sooner were the ceremonies of the wedding over but the mother-in-law
        began to show herself in her true colors. The poor girl bore all
        patiently, and dared not tell her father, who would have rattled her
        off; for his wife governed him entirely. When she had done her work, she
        used to go into the chimney-corner, and sit down among cinders and
        ashes, which made her commonly be called Cinderwench; but the youngest,
        who was not so rude and uncivil as the eldest, called her Cinderella.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Cinderella, notwithstanding her mean apparel, was a hundred
        times handsomer than her sisters, though they were always dressed very
        richly. It happened that the King's son gave a ball, and invited all
        persons of fashion to it. Our young misses were also invited, for they
        cut a very grand figure among the quality. They were mightily delighted
        at this invitation, and wonderfully busy in choosing out such gowns,
        petticoats, and head-clothes as might become them. This was a new
        trouble to Cinderella; for it was she who ironed her sisters' linen, and
        plaited their ruffles; they talked all day long of nothing but how they
        should be dressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        "For my part," said the eldest, "I will wear my red velvet suit with
        French trimming." "And I," said the youngest, "shall have my usual
        petticoat; but then, to make amends for that, I will put on my
        gold-flowered manteau, and my diamond stomacher, which is far from being
        the most ordinary one in the world." They sent for the best tire-woman
        they could get to make up their head-dresses and adjust their double
        pinners, and they had their red brushes and patches from Mademoiselle de
        la Poche. Cinderella was likewise called up to them to be consulted in
        all these matters, for she had excellent notions, and advised them
        always for the best, nay, and offered her services to dress their heads,
        which they were very willing she should do.
      </p>
      <p>
        As she was doing this, they said to her: "Cinderella, would you not be
        glad to go to the ball?" "Alas!" said she, "you only jeer me; it is not
        for such as I am to go thither." "Thou art in the right of it," replied
        they; "it would make the people laugh to see a Cinderwench at a ball."
        Anyone but Cinderella would have dressed their heads awry, but she was
        very good, and dressed them perfectly well They were almost two days
        without eating, so much were they transported with joy. They broke above
        a dozen laces in trying to be laced up close, that they might have a
        fine slender shape, and they were continually at their looking-glass.
      </p>
      <p>
        At last the happy day came; they went to Court, and Cinderella followed
        them with her eyes as long as she could, and when she had lost sight of
        them, she fell a-crying. Her godmother, who saw her all in tears, asked
        her what was the matter. "I wish I could--I wish I could--"; she was not
        able to speak the rest, being interrupted by her tears and sobbing. This
        godmother of hers, who was a fairy, said to her, "Thou wishest thou
        couldst go to the ball; is it not so?" "Y--es," cried Cinderella, with a
        great sigh. "Well," said her godmother, "be but a good girl, and I will
        contrive that thou shalt go." Then she took her into her chamber, and
        said to her, "Run into the garden, and bring me a pumpkin." Cinderella
        went immediately to gather the finest she could get, and brought it to
        her godmother, not being able to imagine how this pumpkin could make her
        go to the ball.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her godmother scooped out all the inside of it, having left nothing but
        the rind; which done, she struck it with her wand, and the pumpkin was
        instantly turned into a fine coach, gilded all over with gold. She then
        went to look into her mouse-trap, where she found six mice, all alive,
        and ordered Cinderella to lift up a little the trapdoor, when, giving
        each mouse, as it went out, a little tap with her wand, the mouse was
        that moment turned into a fine horse, which altogether made a very fine
        set of six horses of a beautiful mouse-colored dapple-gray.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being at a loss for a coachman, "I will go and see," says Cinderella,
        "if there is never a rat in the rat-trap--we may make a coachman of
        him." "Thou art in the right," replied her godmother; "go and look."
        Cinderella brought the trap to her, and in it there were three huge
        rats. The fairy made choice of one of the three which had the largest
        beard, and, having touched him with her wand, he was turned into a fat,
        jolly coach- man, who had the smartest whiskers eyes ever beheld.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, she said to her: "Go again into the garden, and you will
        find six lizards behind the watering-pot, bring them to me." She had no
        sooner done so but her godmother turned them into six footmen, who
        skipped up immediately behind the coach, with their liveries all
        bedaubed with gold and silver, and clung as close behind each other as
        if they had done nothing else their whole lives. The Fairy then said to
        Cinderella:
      </p>

      <p>
        "Well, you see here an equipage fit to go to the ball with; are you not
        pleased with it?" "Oh! yes," cried she; "but must I go thither as I am,
        in these nasty rags?" Her godmother only just touched her with her wand,
        and, at the same instant, her clothes were turned into cloth of gold and
        silver, all beset with jewels.
      </p>
      <img src="http://unsplash.it/400/400" class="align-right slide-in" />
      <p>
        This done, she gave her a pair of glass slippers, the prettiest in the
        whole world. Being thus decked out, she got up into her coach; but her
        godmother, above all things, commanded her not to stay till after
        midnight, telling her, at the same time, that if she stayed one moment
        longer, the coach would be a pumpkin again, her horses mice, her
        coachman a rat, her footmen lizards, and her clothes become just as they
        were before.
      </p>
      <p>
        She promised her godmother she would not fail of leaving the ball before
        midnight; and then away she drives, scarce able to contain herself for
        joy. The King's son who was told that a great princess, whom nobody
        knew, was come, ran out to receive her; he gave her his hand as she
        alighted out of the coach, and led her into the ball, among all the
        company. All the ladies were busied in considering her clothes and
        headdress, that they might have some made next day after the same
        pattern, provided they could meet with such fine material and as able
        hands to make them. .

      <p>
        .There was immediately a profound silence, they left off dancing, and
        the violins ceased to play, so attentive was everyone to contemplate the
        singular beauties of the unknown new-comer. Nothing was then heard but a
        confused noise of: "Ha! how handsome she is! Ha! how handsome she is!"
        The King himself, old as he was, could not help watching her, and
        telling the Queen softly that it was a long time since he had seen so
        beautiful and lovely a creature.
      </p>
      <p>
        The King's son conducted her to the most honorable seat, and afterward
        took her out to dance with him; she danced so very gracefully that they
        all more and more admired her. A fine collation was served up, whereof
        the young prince ate not a morsel, so intently was he busied in gazing
        on her. She went and sat down by her sisters, showing them a thousand
        civilities, giving them part of the oranges and citrons which the Prince
        had presented her with, which very much surprised them, for they did not
        know her. While Cinderella was thus amusing her sisters, she heard the
        clock strike eleven and three-quarters,whereupon she immediately made a
        courtesy to the company and hasted away as fast as she could
